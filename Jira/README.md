# JIRA Integration API

A FastAPI-based RESTful API for interacting with JIRA to fetch and manage boards, epics, stories, tasks, descriptions, comments, attachments, and project users. The API provides endpoints to retrieve hierarchical data (boards â†’ epics â†’ stories â†’ tasks/subtasks), manage issues, and save data to a JSON file.

---

##  Overview

This project is a Python-based FastAPI application that integrates with the JIRA REST API to fetch and manage project data. It allows users to:

* Retrieve JIRA boards, epics, stories, tasks, and subtasks in a hierarchical structure.
* Fetch and update issue descriptions, comments, and attachments.
* Create, update, and delete issues.
* Retrieve users associated with a JIRA project.
* Save the board-epic-story-task hierarchy to a JSON file.

The API uses the Atlassian JIRA REST API (version 3) and supports robust error handling, logging, and Atlassian Document Format (ADF) parsing for descriptions and comments.

---

##  Features

* **Hierarchical Data Retrieval:** Boards â†’ Epics â†’ Stories â†’ Tasks/Subtasks with metadata.
* **Issue Management:** Create, read, update, delete issues.
* **Metadata Support:** Fetch/update descriptions, comments, attachments.
* **Project Users:** Retrieve users per JIRA project.
* **Data Export:** Save the full board hierarchy as `jira_hierarchy.json`.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Supports 401, 403, 404 with detailed logs.
* **Environment Configuration:** Secure setup via `.env` file.

##  Code Structure & Highlights

* **Environment Validation:** `.env` loaded via `python-dotenv`. All credentials are validated on startup.
* **API Integration:** `requests` + `HTTPBasicAuth` to access JIRA endpoints.
* **Models:** Pydantic-based data models for Board, Epic, Story, Task, Subtask.
* **ADF Parsing:** Handles JIRA Atlassian Document Format (ADF) to read/write descriptions and comments.
* **Error Handling:** Centralized with status-aware responses (401, 403, 404, 500).
* **Reusability:** Utility functions like `extract_description`, `extract_comments`, `get_epic_link_field_id`, and `safe_request()` support maintainable code.
